##                                Raspberry Pi                       Configuration Manual    



** Set up the sd card for Raspberry PI ** In order to have a working archlinux arm on the raspberry you have to follow up the instructions from the official [Arch Linux Arm site](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-3). *Remeber that this site presumes you have already a working Linux system, so all the commands are in the linux shell.
There is not a .img in oreder to make a bootable card in rufus or other similar programs* After you inserted the sd card you have to umount it first 'sudo umount /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2'
